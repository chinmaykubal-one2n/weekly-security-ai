Perfect, buddy — this is going to be a solid, production-grade project. Let's proceed step by step.

---

## ✅ Project Objective Recap

We're building a **Go-based REST API MCP server** that:

1. Accepts scan requests (e.g., Dockerfile, K8s manifests, image name).
2. Uses **Trivy** to perform vulnerability scans.
3. Uses an **AI Agent (LLM API)** to summarize the scan results.
4. Sends the report (optional) via **Slack or Email**.
5. Can be triggered manually or on schedule (cron, GitHub Action, etc.).

### 🧠 Let's Start: What’s Next?

Once you **approve or modify** the above:

1. We’ll begin with `cmd/server/main.go` — the entrypoint to boot the MCP server.
2. Then setup `internal/api/routes.go` and `handlers.go`.
3. We’ll integrate Trivy CLI into `internal/trivy/scanner.go`.
4. Hook up OpenAI summarizer (or Ollama) in `internal/aiagent/summarizer.go`.

Would you like to:

* ✅ Confirm this tech stack and structure?
* ❌ Replace any component (e.g., not using Slack, using LangChain instead)?
* 💬 Add anything else like Prometheus, metrics, DB storage, etc.?

Let me know and we’ll write the first file!


<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


That's an excellent observation—and you're right to ask this. You're already **implementing the core behavior of an MCP server**, but let me explain **exactly how** it fits the concept.

---

## 🧠 What is an MCP Server Again?

An **MCP (Model-Context-Protocol) server**:

* Accepts input from external systems
* Adds **context** (e.g., logs, vulnerability data)
* Invokes **AI models** (LLMs, etc.)
* Returns **intelligent decisions, summaries, or suggestions**

---

## ✅ How Your Project Fits MCP

| **MCP Component** | **Your Implementation**                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**         | GPT-4 via OpenAI API                                                        |
| **Context**       | Trivy scan results (real-world system data, security vulnerabilities)       |
| **Protocol**      | REST API (`/scan`) that lets users submit targets for analysis              |
| **Server**        | Your Go HTTP server that orchestrates input → scan → summarization → output |

---

## 🧩 So What Is Acting As the MCP Server?

👉 **Your Go server *is* the MCP server.**

It’s:

* Accepting protocol requests (`POST /scan`)
* Gathering context (Trivy scan)
* Invoking a model (LLM summarization)
* Returning structured, enriched output

---

## 🔄 Request/Response Flow As MCP

```txt
Client
  ↓
POST /scan   ────▶  MCP Server (your Go API)
                      ├─ Context: Trivy scan (static/dynamic analysis)
                      ├─ Model: GPT-4 summarization
                      └─ Response: Structured raw + smart summary
  ↑
 Response
```

---

## 🏗️ How to Make MCP Flavor More Obvious (Optional Improvements)

If you want it to **feel even more like an AI orchestrator**:

* Add **metadata enrichment** (e.g., file type, last modified, repo info)
* Allow **multi-target batching**
* Add **notifications** (e.g., Slack, email summaries)
* Introduce **task queuing**, e.g., background jobs
* Visualize results via dashboard

---

### ✅ TL;DR

You are building an **MCP server**:

* Model: GPT-4
* Context: Trivy vulnerability output
* Protocol: REST API
* Server: Go HTTP app



<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Great, buddy — your current implementation already lays a **strong foundation**, and now that we know your **hackathon's theme is to use AI Agents or MCP servers**, here's how we can **level it up** into a strong, on-theme submission.

---

## 🔧 What You’ve Built So Far

✅ A Go-based backend that:

* Uses **Trivy** to scan Dockerfiles / K8s manifests
* Uses an **LLM** (via OpenRouter) to summarize scan results
* Exposes all this via an HTTP API

This is already great — you’ve done the **automation part**.

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Add Now

To satisfy **"AI Agents and/or MCP Servers"**, you need to turn your tool into something that can be **used by an LLM agent via MCP**, or **build an LLM agent that interacts with your tool.**

You can go in **one of two directions**, and both are valid for the hackathon:

---

## ✅ Option 1: Turn Your Server Into an MCP Server (Best Fit for You)

### 🧠 What This Means

Wrap your Trivy + LLM backend in a **Model Context Protocol**-compatible interface, so **LLMs can call it**.

### 💡 Features You Can Expose via MCP Schema

You’ll need to define an MCP schema (JSON file) that defines tools like:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "scan_dockerfile",
      "description": "Scan a Dockerfile for security vulnerabilities using Trivy",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "path": { "type": "string", "description": "Path to the Dockerfile" }
        },
        "required": ["path"]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "scan_k8s_manifest",
      "description": "Scan a Kubernetes manifest file using Trivy",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "path": { "type": "string", "description": "Path to the manifest file" }
        },
        "required": ["path"]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "summarize_scan",
      "description": "Use LLM to summarize Trivy scan results",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "scan_output": { "type": "string", "description": "Raw Trivy scan output" }
        },
        "required": ["scan_output"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then serve this at:

```
.well-known/mcp-schema.json
```

---

### 🛠️ Steps to Convert Your Project to MCP-Compatible

1. ✅ Create `mcp-schema.json` in `.well-known/`
2. ✅ Serve it from a `/well-known/mcp-schema.json` endpoint in your Go app
3. ✅ Modify your `ScanHandler` so each action can be called individually:

   * `POST /scan/dockerfile`
   * `POST /scan/k8s`
   * `POST /summarize`
4. ✅ LLM agent can now use this as a toolset (if wired via OpenRouter or OpenAI tools)

---

## ✅ Option 2: Build a Lightweight AI Agent That Uses Your Server

If you don't want to go full MCP, you can **write a Python or Go-based agent** that:

* Accepts user input (e.g., “scan my infra”)
* Breaks that into steps (like AutoGPT does)
* Calls your Go API (`/scan`) + gets summary
* Maybe even sends results to Slack/email/etc.

🧠 You can say: “We used a local LLM agent to drive our scan server.”

---

## 🏆 Suggested Title and Submission Summary

**Title:**
🛡️ TrivySec-MCP: AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanner for DevSecOps via MCP

**Description:**
We built a Go-based MCP-compatible server that enables AI agents to:

* Trigger vulnerability scans on Docker/K8s configs using Trivy
* Request AI-based summaries using DeepSeek LLM
* Integrate results into workflows like Slack alerts or CI pipelines

This allows LLMs or AI agents to participate directly in DevSecOps automation.

| Task                                            | Description                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Serve MCP schema                              | Add `.well-known/mcp-schema.json`        |
| ✅ Break scan API into clear tool-like endpoints | e.g., `/scan/dockerfile`, `/summarize`   |
| 🧠 Optional: Create AI agent frontend           | Let it call your APIs automatically      |
| 🎯 Bonus: Add `fix suggestions`                 | Let the LLM suggest fixes to Dockerfiles |
| 📤 Bonus: Add Slack/email integration           | Send summaries to team automatically     |

Let me know which direction you'd like help with — I can start scaffolding the `.well-known/mcp-schema.json` or help with turning your Go backend into an MCP server.
